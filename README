Titanium module for PEPhotoCropImage
====================================

This is my first attempt to build a native module for Titanium.
The module wraps the excellent library developed by kishikawa katsumi,

that you can find here:

https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi/PEPhotoCropEditor

that allows to crop and resize images, in a similar way the native iOS Photo Gallery.app does.

Using the module is quite simple:

Import the module in your code with:

var TiCropImageEditor = require('it.etnatraining.TiCIE');

then create an image editor instance with:

var imageEditor = TiCropImageEditor.createImageEditor();

and open the image editor:

imageEditor.open(e.media);

The only accepted parameter is a Ti.Blob that represent the image you want to edit.

Currently the resized/rotated image is written to a file in the bundle Documents directory.
To retrieve the name of the file, you need to listen for the event "done":

imageEditor.addEventListener("done", function(e) {
	alert(e.filename);
});

The filename is found in the filename property of the event object.

Notes
=====

- This is a very early/alpha release. I don't suggest to use it in production right now, cause I don't take care carefully of memory management.
- This module is iOS only
- You can use this module only with Titanium SDK > 3.1.1GA, cause the original library uses ARC and only since Titanium 3.1.0.GA, ARC can be used for module development, as documented here:
